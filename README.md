# vw

vw is a tiny web demos previewer. 

It takes path to any github folder and converts it to simple preview page with a demo and source listings.

## Usage

For example if you have GitHub URL like

```
https://github.com/foo/foorepo/tree/main/demo
```

replace it with


```
https://itanka9.github.io/vw/#foo/foorepo/demo
```

A common template is:

```
https://itanka9.github.io/vw/#{user}/{repo}/{path}
```
